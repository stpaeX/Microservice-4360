# Microservices Architecture
Microservices are independently deployable components. It follows a development approach that designs software applications as a set of independent and loosely coupled services. 
These individual functional modules perform specifically defined, separate tasks autonomously. Microservices allow agility and scalability, 
organizations can scale parts of their applications that are causing bottlenecks.

## Microservices Characteristics
Microservice architecture is strongly encapsulated, loosely coupled, and allows for independent deployments.
The three core objectives are scalability, flexibility of deployments and development agility.
* Loosely coupled
* Runs independently 
* Strongly encapsulated


## Benefits
Organizations that adopt microservice architecture benefit from greater agility. facilitates continuous 
development and enables deployment as soon as features are developed. Since deployments are independent of another, which reduces risk.  
MSA offers the ability to scale only the portions of an application that are a bottleneck. 
* Agility
* Scalability
* independently deployable
* Resiliency


## Cost and Risk
Despite the many benefit of microservices, there exist drawbacks that are disruptive to many
aspects of the organization. Changes to architecture will require application leaders to be willing to manage cultural 
and technical differences. Developers need strong application architecture skills and the ability to adopt
design patterns and models. Data management differs and impacts reporting and analytic practices. 
Teams are given the freedom to build and assemble parts of the application they see fit. Microservice architecture 
can also be complex which can impact security and runtime. When executed poorly, MSA may not yield the expected
benefits.
* Complexity 
* Agile and Devops
* Team autonomy
* Application infrastructure
